Node was created by Ryan Dahl. 
- Node.js (Node) is an Open Source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. 
- Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. 
- Node is sometimes referred to as a programming language or software development framework, but neither is true; it is strictly a JavaScript runtime.

- Node incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine, the same one used in Google Chrome and other browsers. 

Node Applications:
- A Node application runs in a single process.
- A Node server can handle thousands of concurrent connections without having to contend with thread concurrency issues or the overhead multithreading brings.

- Node.js is event-driven and runs asynchronously. 
- Code written for the Node environment does not follow the traditional model of receive, process, send, wait and receive found in other systems. 
Instead, Node implements an event loop that processes incoming requests as they stack up in the event queue

Node is well suited to real-time applications such as chats, streaming services, internet of things (IoT) offerings or single-page applications.

Node is not suited to every type of workload, however. 
For example, because of its single-threaded nature, Node might not be able to effectively run a processor-intensive web application that requires heavy server-side computations. 
The computational load could end up blocking incoming requests and degrading overall performance

Both browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language. 

npm is the standard package manager for Node.js
